# CECS 378 Reading Assignment: Cryptograpgy
## 20 points

### Assignment Description
Answer the following questions from the Chapter 2, 20, and 21 reading from your textbook. You may work on these questions with one or two other partners, but *all* students must submit the document individually in their own repositories along with each student's name documented with the submission.

1. How many keys are required for two people to communicate via a symmetric cipher?
   * There are two keys, the public key, and the private key are used for public-key encryption for users to communicate with a symmetric cipher. The public key is used for encryption when a user sends a message to another user, while the private key is used for decryption when a user receives a message. All participants have access to the public key, whereas a private key is held by a participant individually.  

2. What is a message authentication code?
   * The message authentication code represents a method that includes using a secret key to create a small block of data. This method involves having two people share a secret key. The message authentication code is measured and considered as a complex function of the message and the key when the sender sends a message to the receiver. Now the receiver performs a message to calculate by using a secret key to generate a new code.
   * If the received code of the message between the sender and the receiver matches the calculation of the code, then:
      - The receiver will ensure the sender that the message has not been modified.
      - The receiver assures that the message came from the alleged sender since no one must know the identifier of the secret key
      - The hacker cannot modify the sequence number since the receiver ensures the proper sequence when the message includes a sequence number. 
     

3. What are the principal ingredients of a public-key cryptosystem?
   * The three principal ingredients of a public-key cryptosystem are digital signature, symmetric key distribution, and secret key encryptions:
     - Digital Signature
       - the result of a cryptographic transformation of data that provides a security mechanism for verifying the original authentication, and data integrity.
       - It is defined as a data-dependent bit pattern, generated by an agent as a function of a file, message, or other form of data block.
       - An agent can access the data block and its signature to verify the data block has been signed by the signer, and that the data block has never been modified in the system.
     - Symmetric Key Distribution
       - To create a certificate, the user must include a public key associated with their User ID with a block signed by a third party. Thus, it includes the validation of the certificate signed by a third party.
       - A user can present his or her public key to the party to securely obtain a signed security
     - Secret key Encryptions
       - Two parties privately communicate with each other by sharing a secret key to protect their emails from being traced by hackers.
       - In order to share a key, one party must come up with an idea so that nobody would know, or another party could generate an identifier of the secret key to privately exchange with an associated party.
    
5. With the ECB mode, if there is an error in a block of the transmitted ciphertext, only the corresponding plaintext block is affected. However, in the CBC mode, this error propagates. For example, an error in the transmitted C1 (Figure 20.6, pg. 622 in CSPaP) obviously corrupts P1 and P2.
   1. Are any blocks beyond P2 affected?
       * The output block of P3 depends only on the input blocks of C2, and C3
   2. Suppose that there is a bit error in the source version of P1. Through how many cipher-text blocks is this error propagated? What is the effect at the receiver?
       * The effect of the calculation of C2 after the input of the calculation for C1 moves on indefinitely for all ciphertext blocks are affected. 

6. You want to build a hardware device to do block encryption in the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode using an algorithm stronger than DES. 3DES is a good candidate. Figure 20.11 on pg. 632 in CSPaP shows two possibilities, both of which follow from the definition of CBC. Which of the two would you choose:
   1. For security?
   2. For performance?
   3. And answer why for each.
      * I would choose performance over security since it matches most measurements of the one loop of brute force attacks. In addition, the measurement of the performance can be measured expected to be smaller than the normal variation. 
      
8. Padding may not always be appropriate. For example, one might wish to store the encrypted data in the same memory buffer that originally contained the plaintext. In that case, the ciphertext must be the same length as the original plaintext. A mode for that purpose is the ciphertext stealing (CTS) mode. Figure 20.12a on pg. 633 in CSPaP shows an implementation of this mode.
   1. Explain how it works.
        * The purpose of ciphertext stealing is to alter the CBC mode to make sure that the length of the ciphertext matches the length of the original plaintext. This method is used for encrypting the data blocks but also the last two blocks of the plaintext. 
   3. Describe how to decrypt `Cnâˆ’1` and `Cn`.
        * To decrypt Cn-1, we must apply the standard decryption algorithm to obtain Pn-1. Whereas if we decrypt Cn, then we apply the standard decryption algorithm to obtain Pn. Finally, we swap the two factors that we have obtained in this particular problem. 
      

9. It is possible to use a hash function to construct a block cipher with a structure similar to DES. Because a hash function is one-way and a block cipher must be reversible (to decrypt), how is it possible?
    * Since it is possible to use a hash function to create a block cipher, hash functions generally execute faster than DES. Thus, this is possible because the cryptographic hash functions in library code are widely available for users to easily access the code. 

11.  Perform encryption and decryption using the RSA algorithm for the following:
    1.  `p=3`; `q=11`, `e=7`, `M=5`
     - n = pxq = 3x11 = 33
     - sigma(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1) = (3 - 1)(11 - 1) = 20
     - gcd (sigma(n), e) = gcd(20, 7) = 1; 1 < e < sigma(n) = 1 < 7 < 33
     - d = (sigma(n)+1)/e = 21/7 = 3
     - C = Me(mod n) = 5*7(mod 33) = 2
     - M = Cd(mod n) = (2*3)%33 = 6
    2.  `p=5`; `q=11`, `e=3`, `M=9`
     - n = 55
     - sigma(n) = 40
     - gcd(40, 3) = 1; 1 < 3 < 40
     - d = -13 mod 40 = 27
     - C = 9^3(mod 55) = 14
     - M = Cd(mod n) = 14^27(mod 55) = 9
    3.  `p=7`; `q=11`, `e=17`, `M=8`
     - n = pxq = 77
     - sigma(n) = 60
     - gcd (sigma(n), e) = gcd(60, 17) = 1; 1 < 17 < 60
     - d = -7 mod 60 = 53
     - C = Me(mod n) = 8^17(mod 77) = 57
     - M = Cd(mod n) = 57^53(mod 77) = 8
    4.  `p=11`; `q=13`, `e=11`, `M=7`
     - n = pxq = 143
     - sigma(n) = 120
     - gcd (sigma(n), e) = gcd(120, 11) = 1; 1 < 11 < 120
     - d = e^-1 mod sigma(n) = 11 mod 120 = 11
     - C = Me(mod n) = 7^11(mod 143) = 106
     - M = Cd(mod n) = 106^11 mod 143 = 8
    5.  `p=17`; `q=31`, `e=7`, `M=2`
     - n = pxq = 527
     - sigma(n) = 480
     - gcd (sigma(n), e) = gcd(20, 7) = 1; 1 < e < sigma(n) = 1 < 7 < 480
     - d = e^-1 mod sigma(n) = 7^-1 mod 480 = 343
     - C = Me(mod n) = 2^7(mod 527) = 128
     - M = Cd(mod n) = 128^343(mod 527) = 2

13.  Suppose we have a set of blocks encoded with the RSA algorithm and we do not have the private key. Assume `n=pq`, `e` is the public key. Suppose also someone tells us they know one of the plaintext blocks has a common factor with `n`. Does this help us in any way
    - Yes it does help since the encoded block will also have a common factor with n modulo n if a plaintext block has a common factor with n modulo n. This is because we encode blocks that are smaller than n = pq.
